## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the Respository:

## Additional Notes
- State Manager: The application uses Flutter Riverpod for state management. Refer to Riverpod Documentation for more details. (https://riverpod.dev/docs/introduction/getting_started)
- Architecture: The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern for better code organization and separation of concerns.
- Faker API Image Responses: Note that the Faker API sometimes returns empty images. The application handles this scenario gracefully by displaying an error message instead.
